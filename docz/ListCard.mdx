# ListCard

## Signature

```
<ListCard title={String} desc={string} />
```

## Example

```
<ListCard title={'This is what a title would look like'} desc={'some interesting text'} />s
```

<Playground>
  <ListCard
    title={'This is what a title would look like'}
    desc={'some interesting text'}
  />
</Playground>

## Note

`<ListCard />` uses `React.Fragment` as a parent node for `<li>` so it requires a parent node that is a parent for `<li>`
