import ListCard from 'components/ListCard';

# ListCard

## Note

`<ListCard />` uses `React.Fragment` as a parent node for `<li>` so it requires a parent node that is a parent for `<li>`

## Example

```
<ListCard title={'This is what a title would look like'} desc={'some interesting text'} />s
```

<ListCard
  title={'This is what a title would look like'}
  desc={'some interesting text'}
/>
